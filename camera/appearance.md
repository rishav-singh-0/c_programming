## Basics

1. Brightness: It defines the overall lightness of the image.
Choosing the higher value increases the live view brightness.

2. Contrast: It defines the difference in color and light between objects or regions.
Choosing the higher value makes the dark portion too dark, and the light portion too
light.

“It’s the dramatic yet delicate dance between rich, velvety blacks and pure, clean whites, and every tone in between,” says photographer Trevor Traynor.

3. Saturation: It defines the colourfulness of the image color.
Choosing the higher value increases the color strength.

4. Hue: It defines the true color or shade of the image.
Choosing the higher value increases the hue of the image.

5. Sharpness: It defines the details of the image by sharpening the edges in the image.
Choosing the higher value increases the sharpness of the image.

6. 3DNR (Dynamic Noise Reduction):

3D-DNR: Digital Noise Reduction decreases picture noise and reduces colour
mixture errors. 3D-DNR stands for multidimensional digital noise reduction
(DNR: Digital Noise Reduction) and was developed for shooting at night or in
dimly lit places.

> More the value of gain, more is the noise filtered.

7. Lens Correction
- Several Optical distortions can be caused due to error in optical lens which
  can further result into image deformation. To correct these distortions, lens
  correction feature is provided.
> Note: If Lens Correction feature is enabled, then FPS value may decrease.

8. Exposure Ratio Mode: Exposure ratio is the ratio of long to short exposure time
to be set for capturing the frames.

9. WDR Mode: Select WDR mode as Digital Overlap or Multiple Exposure.
Choosing the higher WDR strength value will enhance the dark region
