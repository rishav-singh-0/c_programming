# Glib

GLib is a lower-level library that provides many useful definitions and functions, including definitions for basic types and their limits, standard macros, type conversions, byte order, memory allocation, warnings and assertions, message logging, timers, string utilities, hook functions, a lexical scanner, dynamic loading of modules, and automatic string completion.

# BLAS / LAPACK

BLAS and LAPACK work similar to GSL, but they are more optimized for linear algebra.

The blas and lapack libraries are high-performance libraries for linear algebra. If you are dealing with large matrices and you have the need for speed, then probably you should look into using BLAS / LAPACK, it will probably be faster than GSL.
